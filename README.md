Delta Phase II 2016 Field Data

Measurements of energy balance components and additional variables were taken in five alfalfa fields, five corn fields, and four pasture sites. Half-hourly measurements and daily sums are provided in separate .csv files for each field. Meta-data, maps, photographs, and interactive plots of key variables are also provided in .html files for each field. Descriptions of the variables are provided in separate files for half-hourly and daily data.  

Data uploaded at this time has not been specifically filtered for precipitation which may cause erroneous readings for some instruments. We expect few issues during the main growing season which is the period of interest for this project. For some stations data continued to be collected over the winter and in a few cases is still being collected currently.  We have included winter data where available, but it should be used with caution due to many days with precipitation.
